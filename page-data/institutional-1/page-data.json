For our purposes, we delineated properties held for less than 1.5 years as flipped properties, and for more than 1.5 years as a holdings property. This gives an added dimension to help understand the spatial dynamics of investor owned properties. Flips could be sold to another investor, or could be sold to a new owner, while holdings are kept under investor ownership, and often rented out using a property management firm.","frontmatter":{"title":"","category":"","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAABCAYAAADeko4lAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAADElEQVQI12P4T2UAAJxdT7EMbDMUAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC","width":400,"height":8,"src":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/497c6/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/497c6/placeholder.png 1x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/2a4de/placeholder.png 1.5x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/ee604/placeholder.png 2x","tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='8'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%208'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'/%3e","aspectRatio":50,"srcWebp":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/1f5c5/placeholder.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/1f5c5/placeholder.webp 1x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/ad85c/placeholder.webp 1.5x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/58556/placeholder.webp 2x","originalName":"placeholder.png"}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/institutional-1/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/institutional-1/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3272233147"]}
