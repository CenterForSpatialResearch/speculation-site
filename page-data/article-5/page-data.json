In total the effects of converting a cheap housing stock to a profitable one contributes to a growing reality of home ownership being financially untenable for a large number of people. The trend toward investor flipping moves the real estate profits from smaller local investors to larger external investors.</p>\n<p>On the whole, housing flips have decreased in volume since their peak prior to the financial crisis, and have followed a similar rise, fall, and slow recovery as owner occupant purchases. </p>\n<p>The recovery since the financial crisis is driven in large part by an increase in institutional investment into housing flips, while single investor flips have not recovered at all. </p>\n<p>Of particular interest in the study was to examine the frequency in which investors sell to people intending to live in their homes - the normative HGTV style of house flipping. We can see here that while that happened frequently before 2008, it has largely leveled off in popularity since then.  An increasing trend that we do see is the amount institutional investors are flipping properties. An increase in flips from institutional investors but a decrease in flips from investors sold to occupants means that the slack is being taken up by investors buying the flips of investors. &#x3C; INSERT FINALIZED IMAGES ></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Insitutionalized Flipping","subtitle":"From HGTV to Private Equity","tags":["flip"],"category":"Narrative","project":"https://google.com","demo":"https://google.com","date":"27 November, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/article-5/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3272233147"]}
