Investor purchases occurred in areas with higher rates of renter households, however not overwhelmingly higher. This suggests that investors are not focused on neighborhoods already full of predominantly rental buildings, but rather on low income neighborhoods with both homeowners and renters. The demographic differences between these geographies suggest that Philadelphia's poorest residents and residents of color are disproportionately impacted by the increase of investor activity.\nIn Newark, there is less divergence in the geographies of investor purchases versus owner occupant purchases and more investigation into why these patterns exist in Philadelphia to a far greater extent than Newark could shed light onto the differences between the two cities in this context.","frontmatter":{"title":"","category":"","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAABCAYAAADeko4lAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAADElEQVQI12P4T2UAAJxdT7EMbDMUAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC","width":400,"height":8,"src":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/497c6/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/497c6/placeholder.png 1x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/2a4de/placeholder.png 1.5x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/ee604/placeholder.png 2x","tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='8'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%208'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'/%3e","aspectRatio":50,"srcWebp":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/1f5c5/placeholder.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/1f5c5/placeholder.webp 1x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/ad85c/placeholder.webp 1.5x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/58556/placeholder.webp 2x","originalName":"placeholder.png"}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/diverging-1/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/diverging-1/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3272233147"]}
