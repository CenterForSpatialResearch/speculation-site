The frontmatter fields above is where we tell the site what to do for each post, and how it displays them. The required ones are filled out and blank ones I'm not using currently but don't delete them please. Date is self-explanatory, that is currently how posts on the site are being sorted however I thought it might make more sense to sort posts on the main page (\"All\") with date, and then posts within a category using \"order\" so we can make sure posts are being displayed sequentially within a theme without having to fake it with  the date.   Avialable tags are: \"background\" for Background, \"sfr\" for Rise of the SFR, \"flip\" for Institutionalized Flipping, and \"geo\" for Diverging Geographies. Every post can have multiple tags no problem. We can also include a \"category\" as an additional method of showing connections between blocks if we want, that would show up as a subtitle. featuredImage is where the image goes, currently supported filetypes are jpeg jpg png webp tif and tiff. Both the text post and image post are drawn from this so they will show up in the same order. images must go in /src/img/post/ and then whatever the file name is the only thing you need to change in that field. What you name the file doesn't matter as long as it goes in pages/posts it will render, maybe filename should just be used as a way to coordinate from the google doc David set up.","frontmatter":{"title":"","category":"","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAABCAYAAADeko4lAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAADElEQVQI12P4T2UAAJxdT7EMbDMUAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC","width":400,"height":8,"src":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/497c6/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/497c6/placeholder.png 1x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/2a4de/placeholder.png 1.5x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/ee604/placeholder.png 2x","tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='8'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%208'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'/%3e","aspectRatio":50,"srcWebp":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/1f5c5/placeholder.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/1f5c5/placeholder.webp 1x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/ad85c/placeholder.webp 1.5x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/58556/placeholder.webp 2x","originalName":"placeholder.png"}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/0_template/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/0_template/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3272233147"]}
