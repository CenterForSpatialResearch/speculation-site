New investment practices have figured variously in the housing bubble, subprime mortgage crash, subsequent real estate owned property markets, and more recent forms of speculation in single-family rental (SFR) properties. The scale and scope of these purchases are fundamentally reshaping access to housing in the U.S. However very little is known about the spatial dynamics of this transformation at the urban scale.   The acquisition of distressed and real estate owned properties since 2008 by LLCs was explicitly supported by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and was assumed to be a stabilizing force (Fields 2018). However in the years since, research has uncovered many ways in which investor-ownership has been destabilizing for housing markets, served to transfer wealth out of communities of color, and has contributed to increasing rates of eviction (Gilderbloom et al. 2012; Raymond et al. 2018; Molina 2016). Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic some of the largest corporate landlords have been raising $100s of millions in anticipation of acquiring newly distressed properties (“Invitation Homes May Double Single-Family Portfolio” 2020; Gose 2020).   This project investigates the spatial dynamics of investor ownership of residential properties in small-mid sized cities in the Northeast U.S., including Philadelphia, Buffalo, and Newark to start. Understanding the present extents, and spatial patterns of investor activity is necessary as a way to uncover the newest forms of overlap between profit-making and housing. Revealing these geographies and activities is a necessary first step in fighting for housing policies that are indeed for housing, rather than drivers of further speculation.","frontmatter":{"title":"","category":"","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAABCAYAAADeko4lAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAADElEQVQI12P4T2UAAJxdT7EMbDMUAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC","width":400,"height":8,"src":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/497c6/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/497c6/placeholder.png 1x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/2a4de/placeholder.png 1.5x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/ee604/placeholder.png 2x","tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='8'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%208'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'/%3e","aspectRatio":50,"srcWebp":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/1f5c5/placeholder.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/1f5c5/placeholder.webp 1x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/ad85c/placeholder.webp 1.5x,\n/static/25d9c87a28f4f3be6e1759a40b9c9bcc/58556/placeholder.webp 2x","originalName":"placeholder.png"}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/intro1/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/intro1/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3272233147"]}
