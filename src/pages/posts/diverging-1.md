There appears to be an increasing divergence between investor areas of focus, and areas where owner occupants buy homes (or are able to buy homes).
In Philadelphia, higher levels of investor purchases are associated with areas of the city with higher levels of poverty, a greater proportion of black residents, and a much lower proportion of white residents. Investor purchases occurred in areas with higher rates of renter households, however not overwhelmingly higher. This suggests that investors are not focused on neighborhoods already full of predominantly rental buildings, but rather on low income neighborhoods with both homeowners and renters. The demographic differences between these geographies suggest that Philadelphia's poorest residents and residents of color are disproportionately impacted by the increase of investor activity.
In Newark, there is less divergence in the geographies of investor purchases versus owner occupant purchases and more investigation into why these patterns exist in Philadelphia to a far greater extent than Newark could shed light onto the differences between the two cities in this context.
