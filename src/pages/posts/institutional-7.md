Philadelphia has experienced a rapid increase in investor holdings properties across the city, especially driven by institutional investors. While owner occupant purchases (purple) and housing flip purchases (beige) both peaked prior to the financial crisis, investor holdings property purchases (orange) rebounded to pre-crisis levels by 2013 and have since increased rapidly. While still trailing owner-occupant purchases in scale, these holdings purchases are driving a large amount of the growth in Philadelphia real estate purchases. This follows a similar pattern to Newark, however, longer term holdings have overtaken flips in Philadelphia as the main investment in residential real estate while these holdings property purchases still trail flips in Newark.
