Across all cities in our study, both flips and owner occupant purchases peaked before the financial crisis and have been slow to recover. The purchase of small residential properties (1-3 family) by institutional investors, however, slowly emerged in the early 2000s and took off following the financial crisis, now composing the majority of investor purchases and activities across Philadelphia and Newark. This increase is being driven largely by the acceleration of institutional investment into single family and small multi-family real estate.
