This site hosts an evolving set of case studies on investor purchases in small-mid sized U.S. cities. The first city investigated is Philadelphia. Changes in the residential real estate market of Philadelphia in the late 1990s set the stage for private investment through the 2000s. Policy responses through the foreclosure crisis have had dual goals of supporting homeowners and turning over vacant foreclosed properties to new private investors. Philadelphia was a city of homeowners from the latter half of the 20th century until 2017 when it again became a majority renter city. It was particularly hard hit by the foreclosure crisis, and continues to have a higher percentage of foreclosures than the national average (Cherry 2018). Even as it remains one of the more affordable cities in the Northeast, measures of ‘affordability’ often miss high costs associated with fixing up and maintaining the aging and distressed houses (Kramer 2018). Today Philadelphia is experiencing population growth, and rising real estate values (Blumgart 2019). Yet at the same time, the city has a persistent issue with vacancy which was exacerbated by the foreclosure crisis. In this context investor purchases may be having a large influence on housing access in the city -- as will become clear through the analyses below.
