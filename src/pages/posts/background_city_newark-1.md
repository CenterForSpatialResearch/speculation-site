Newark presents an interesting case to study the geographies of institutional investors in residential property. Unlike Philadelphia, Newark is a city of renters. Institutional investors thus likely are not converting formerly owner-occupied housing units into rentals but may be influencing the experience of tenants and rental housing markets. Tenants in Newark have faced increasing housing costs and decreasing incomes since 2000 (Troutt 2017). Newarkâ€™s proximity to New York City and other New Jersey cities has influenced high levels of potential gentrification and displacement. At the same time the city has experienced higher than average rates of foreclosure following the subprime crisis in 2008 (Meyer 2013). In the face of these challenges the current administration under Mayor Ras Baraka has embarked on a new equitable development Masterplan for the city.
