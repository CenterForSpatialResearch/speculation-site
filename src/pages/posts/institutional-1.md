In addition to investigating differences in the behavior of institutional investors and single investors, our analysis also looks at the period of time a property is held. For our purposes, we delineated properties held for less than 1.5 years as flipped properties, and for more than 1.5 years as a holdings property. This gives an added dimension to help understand the spatial dynamics of investor owned properties. Flips could be sold to another investor, or could be sold to a new owner, while holdings are kept under investor ownership, and often rented out using a property management firm.
