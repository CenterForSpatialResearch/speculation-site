Comparing census tracts of high-clustering to census data from each time period in the deeds gives us a better sense of what the socioeconomic makeup of areas with flipping activity are. More flips happen in communities of color, although investors tend to target flips in those communities slightly more than non-investors. Additionally, it is interesting that the investor/non-investor trend has become more aligned over the years
