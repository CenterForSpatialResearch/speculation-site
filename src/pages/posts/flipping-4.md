Some houses flip quite frequently. Among tax deeds that show thousands of house flips over the past 20 years in Philadelphia, there are certain addresses which appear to have been flipped many times.

12 Hamilton Circle has been flipped twelve times, so frequently that it is doubtful that any serious renovation is taking place in between flips. In these situations, usually driven by investors, the flips look more like high-speed asset trading than unlocking unrealized value in an old house.
