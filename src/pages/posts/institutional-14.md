This increase is driven primarily by institutional investors (orange), which only saw a modest decline in rate of purchase after the financial crisis but have really taken off starting in 2013. Single Investor purchases (beige) of residential properties on the other hand had relative peaks in 2006, 2007, and 2014 but have for the most part stagnated.
