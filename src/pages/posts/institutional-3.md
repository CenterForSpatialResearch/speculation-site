Single and small investors are those classified as having purchased 2 or more properties in a period of less than 2 years. These investors often work for real estate firms or brokerages like Century 21, RE/MAX, Coldwell Banker, etc. Itâ€™s unclear from the data or from literature whether these investors are operating as part of a broader institutional effort or if they are operating on their own accord. Based on the diverging trends between institutional investors and these single/small investors it seems more likely to be the latter.
