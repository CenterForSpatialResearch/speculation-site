The trend of streamlined distributions describing the spatial qualities in flips probably reflects in some way how the same data used to analyze flips is also what is used to judge their profitability. Whereas the trend of frequently flipped properties probably shows a change in what flips means for the buyer. Houses flipped every few years cannot realistically mean major renovations each time like in the normative sense of house flipping, but are more akin to a less liquid form of asset trading that has come to housing as part of the larger financialization of homes.
