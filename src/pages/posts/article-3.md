Across all cities in our study, both flips and owner occupant purchases peaked before the financial crisis and have been slow to recover. The purchase of Single Family Rentals, however, slowly emerged in the early 2000s but took off following the financial crisis, and now composes the majority of investor purchases and activities across Philadelphia and Newark.

This increase is being driven largely by the acceleration of institutional investment into single family real estate. Across the cities in our study, single investors or small investors purchases of single family real estate fell significantly following the financial crisis and haven't recovered, similar to owner occupant purchases of single family real estate. Institutional Investment has primarily been driving the post-crisis real estate boom. 

Single and small investors are those classified as having purchased 2 or more properties in a period of less than 2 years. These investors often work for real estate firms or brokerages like Century 21, RE/MAX, Caldwell Banker, etc. Itâ€™s unclear from the data or from literature whether these investors are operating as part of a broader institutional effort or if they are operating on their own accord. Based on the diverging trends between institutional investors and these single/small investors it seems more likely to be the latter. Some research could be done to see whether any of the RE firms these investors work for are accelerating their acquisition of single family rentals on a similar trend to the institutional investors, and whether those RE firms they work for have any publicly known strategy of SFR acquisition.

Institutional Investors, on the other hand, are making up the majority of new Single Family Rental purchases, in line with other research into this emerging market. These institutions are defined as grantees using an LLC, LP, Bank, Corp, or other similar entity name. Many of these have several LLC with similar names, like Steamboat SCM Fund A, Steamboat SCM Fund B, Philadelphia Lotus 01A, 02A, 03A, etc. SFR Philadelphia has Single Family Rental built into its name. These institutions seem keen on taking advantage of this emerging market of Single Family Rentals.

Some interesting patterns emerge when you look into some of the institutional investor purchases, where there seems to be a lot of purchases to and from similar investment companies following a similar pattern. Some of the organizations on here, like Mercury group, are known for dilapidated, vacant and tax delinquent properties that harm neighborhoods. This does point to a lack of total consistency in the data, as these properties may not always be turned into rental properties but might be longer term speculative investments that have their own consequences for neighborhoods.
