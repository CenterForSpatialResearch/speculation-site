Of particular interest in the study was to examine the frequency in which investors sell to people intending to live in their homes - the normative HGTV style of house flipping. We can see here that while that happened frequently before 2008, it has largely leveled off in popularity since then.  An increasing trend that we do see is the amount institutional investors are flipping properties. An increase in flips from institutional investors but a decrease in flips from investors sold to occupants means that the slack is being taken up by investors buying the flips of investors.
