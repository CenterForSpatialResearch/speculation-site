Revealing where these purchases have taken place at a block by block scale gives a fine grained view of the influence of investor-ownership on cities today. For each year purchases were tallied up by census block according to whether they were made by a likely investor or by an owner-occupant. For each block the ratio of investor purchases to the total number of residential parcels was calculated – the same for owner-occupant purchases. This ratio is calibrated to the experience of everyday life on a city block – how many buildings here were purchased this year by investors? by owner-occupants?
