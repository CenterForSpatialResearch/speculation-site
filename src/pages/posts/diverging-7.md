An interesting pattern of geographic divergence emerges when you look at institutional investors compared to single investors. In the period from 2000 to 2006 and from 2007-2009, high purchase clusters occurred on blocks that had similar demographic characteristics. Both single investors and institutional investors acquired residential properties at high rates in neighborhoods like South Philadelphia, the Riverwards, University Southwest, and parts of Northwest Philadelphia and North Delaware.
