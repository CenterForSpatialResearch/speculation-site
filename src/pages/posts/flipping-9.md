If we look at the geographic distribution of investor flipping before and after the financial crisis, we see a similar pattern to institutional investor holdings in Philadelphia. Prior to the financial crisis, both institutional investor flips and single investor flips have a very similar geographic distribution throughout Philadelphia, with higher concentrations of investor flips in Lower North, South Philadelphia, and Lower North Philadelphia.
