Investor Activity is more often concentrated in communities of color and low income neighborhoods. While Newark’s history with redlining is different than Philadelphia’s, with most of the city designated as either red, yellow, or industrial, there is still some pretty clear overlap between where institutional investment in 2018 is being driven and formerly redlined neighborhoods.
