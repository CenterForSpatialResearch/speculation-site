Housing flips, the strategic purchase and sale of a property for an appreciated value, are defined in our study as real estate transfers occurring less than 1.5 years after the purchase of the property. In total the effects of converting a cheap housing stock to a profitable one contributes to a growing reality of home ownership being financially untenable for a large number of people. The trend toward investor flipping moves the real estate profits from smaller local investors to larger external investors.
