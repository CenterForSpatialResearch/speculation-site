This increase in holdings purchases is driven primarily by institutional investors (orange), which only saw a modest decline in rate of purchase after the financial crisis but have really taken off starting around 2013. Single Investor purchases of holdings properties (beige), on the other hand, peaked prior to 2007 and have only made modest increases in recent years.
