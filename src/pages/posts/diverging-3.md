Between 2000 - 2006 high-purchase clusters for investors are largely co-located either with areas of no significance for owner-occupant purchases, or with owner-occupant high purchase clusters. At the height of the housing bubble investors were driving purchases in North Philadelphia, in an area where would-be owner-occupants either didn't, or couldn't, buy homes. However, this divide only grows more severe following the financial crisis. Considering the demographics of the areas of focus for investor and owner-occupant purchases underscores the distinct geographies between these two sets of actors. Across each set of years, even as investor high-purchase clusters shift geographic locations, a similar pattern emerges. Between 2000 and 2006 blocks within investor high-purchase clusters, on average: were less white by a wide margin, had a higher proportion of households living below the federal poverty line, and had moderately higher levels of vacancy, and a higher proportion of renter households. The average median household income for investor high-purchase clusters was $28,000, compared with $39,000 for owner-occupant clusters.
