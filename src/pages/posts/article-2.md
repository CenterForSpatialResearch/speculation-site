Using tax records collected in Philadelphia, Newark, and Buffalo, we can trace real estate purchases made by investors who do not intend to live in the homes they are buying. By filtering out commercial and multi-family properties, this research narrows the focus to single family residences. This research focuses on years between 2000 and 2018. 

Real estate investments take on different forms, some investors choosing to flip properties for quick returns on investment, others choosing to hold properties and earn rental income in addition to property value appreciation. These tax records were categorized using the following criteria for each grantee (aka, purchaser of the property): 

Institutional Investor, Single Family Rental - a property purchased by an LLC, corporation, holdings group, or other institution, held for a period of 1.5 years or more. 

Single Investor, Single Family Rental - a property purchased by a named person with one or more real estate purchases within a year of the transaction, held for a period of 1.5 years or more.

Institutional Investor, Flip - a property purchased by an LLC, corporation, holdings group, or other institution, held for a period of less than 1.5 years.

Single Investor, Flip - a property purchased by a named person with one or more real estate purchases within a year of the transaction, held for a period of less than 1.5 years

Owner-occupant - a property purchased by a named person with no other real estate transactions within a year of purchase, held for any period of time. 

This research will combine analysis of year over year purchases of each category of buyer in the three cities in this study, in addition to spatial analysis using the Local Moran's I algorithm to find high and low purchase clusters for each housing category.
