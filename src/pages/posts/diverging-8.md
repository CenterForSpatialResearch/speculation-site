Following the financial crisis, this pattern starts to diverge. In the period from 2010-2013, institutional investors have high purchase clusters on blocks that have higher rates of poverty and higher proportions of black residents. In the years from 2014-2018, this divergence in high purchase clusters is even more stark. Single investors purchases are concentrated in North Delaware and Northeast Philadelphia, while institutional investors have high purchase clusters in the Riverwards and Lower Northeast and also all over West Philadelphia, Lower North, Upper North, and South Philadelphia, all formerly redlined areas that have historically faced disinvestment.
