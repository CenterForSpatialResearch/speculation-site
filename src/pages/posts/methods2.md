Real estate investments take on different forms, some investors choosing to flip properties for quick returns on investment, others choosing to hold properties and earn rental income in addition to property value appreciation. Each deed was categorized using the following criteria for each grantee (aka, purchaser of the property):  

Institutional Investor - a property purchased by an LLC, corporation, holdings group, or other institution.

Single Investor - a property purchased by a named person with one or more real estate purchases within a year of the transaction. These could be realtors, mom and pop landlords, or larger local landlords.

Owner-occupant - a property purchased by a named person with no other real estate transactions within a year of purchase, held for any period of time.
