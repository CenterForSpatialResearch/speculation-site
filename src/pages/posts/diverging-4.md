Between 2007-2009, 2010-2013, and then again from 2014-2018 (Figure 9) these patterns further diverge. In these latter two periods the investor high-purchase clusters had an even higher proportion of black residents than owner-occupant high-purchase clusters. Further, investor high-purchase clusters had an even greater average proportion of residents living below the poverty line and were of a significantly lower median household income.

Remarkably, for 2015 - 2018 all of the major high-purchase clusters for investor purchases correspond with low-purchase clusters for owner-occupants, except in South Philadelphia. This is a striking difference from patterns during the lead up to and the beginning of the housing bubble (2000-2004) where investor focus areas didn't necessarily correspond with low-purchase clusters for owner-occupants. There appears to be an increasing divergence between investor areas of focus, and areas where owner occupants buy homes (or are able to buy homes).
