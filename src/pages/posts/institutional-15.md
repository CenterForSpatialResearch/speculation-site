The Geographies of these investment purchases are somewhat aligned unlike in Philadelphia, with most of the focus for both institutional investors and single investors since the financial crisis on the south and west regions, with some institutional focus in the Ironbound neighborhood on the East end of Newark as well. Single investors, however, never recovered to pre-crisis rates and that can be seen by the overall lack of blocks in newark with significant single investor purchase volume.
