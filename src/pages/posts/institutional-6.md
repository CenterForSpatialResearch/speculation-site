Some interesting patterns emerge when you look into some of the institutional investor purchases, where there seem to be a lot of purchases to and from similar investment companies following a similar pattern. Some of the organizations on here, like Mercury group, are known for dilapidated, vacant and tax delinquent properties that harm neighborhoods (Kerkstra, 2013, 4). This does point to multiple possible dynamics visible through the data, as these properties may not always be turned into rental properties but might be longer term speculative investments that have their own consequences for neighborhoods.
