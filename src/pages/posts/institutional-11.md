If we look into the neighborhood demographics of these areas of high activity, we can see that from 2014-2018, institutional investors are buying up property in areas that have a slightly higher percentage of renter households, higher vacancy rates, lower proportions of white residents and higher proportions of black residents, more households below the poverty line and lower median incomes. These are similar characteristics to the communities who were alleged to have been targeted by predatory lending practices by banks in the lead up to the financial and foreclosure crisis (DiStefano, 2017).
